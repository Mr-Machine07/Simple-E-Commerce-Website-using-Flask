TECHNOLOGIES USED: Flask, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, DB Browser for SQLite. 

Flask - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.It has no               database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports           extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload         handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.
        Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.
        
Bootstrap - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.

SQLAlchemy - SQLAlchemy, a Python toolkit is a powerful OR Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. Flask-SQLAlchemy is the Flask              extension that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your Flask application.

DB Browser for SQLite - DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.
